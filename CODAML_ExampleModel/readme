1. The RTK signaling pathway
1) description
The RTK signaling pathway involves the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which induce two cancer-related cell functions; proteasomal degradation and G1/S transition. 
This pathway includes diverse kinases such as MEK and ERK that phosphorylate other proteins.

2. The mechanism of the actions of cisplatin and gemcitabine
1) description
Two CASP9-encoded protein isoforms, CASP9a and CASP9b, have different effects on apoptosis. 
CASP9a induces apoptosis whereas CASP9b inhibits this. 
To promote apoptosis, cisplatin increases the amount of CASP9a, and gemcitabine decreases the activity of CASP9b

3. The mechanism of genistein actions for hypertension 
1) description
The mechanism of genistein actions includes inter-cellular relations as well as intra-cellular relations of biological events.
Genistein binds to the FGF1 protein in fibroblasts of the skin; the FGF1 protein activates the FGFR1 protein in the muscle cells of the heart; FGFR1 protein activates the UBC protein; the UBC protein activates the CTGF protein, and CTGF affects hypertension
